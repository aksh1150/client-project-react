              <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Hi, and thanks for visiting my website. I am from Australia, but
                I have spent most of my adult life living in other countries.
                Dubai has been my home since 2011.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have always been a sensitive and intuitive soul, but for most
                of my life, I explored other aspects of myself. I was a court
                reporter for over 25 years. This gave me the opportunity to live
                in various countries and explore many other cultures, all of
                which I am grateful for. But for many years, I had a sense that
                life wanted to take me elsewhere and wanted me to explore other
                aspects of my being.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I began my journey in my mid-40s to see what else life had to
                offer me. It wasn't until I had a profound awakening and healing
                experience through hypnosis that I finally felt able to begin
                the journey of making significant changes in my life and set out
                on the path of becoming a hypnotherapist and energy healer. This
                new way of life has brought about many uplifting changes in my
                thinking and life experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                I welcome the opportunity to work with a variety of people and
                assist them on their healing journey. My experience was one of
                "I'm not sure why I feel like this and how to change my thinking
                patterns, but I know I need some guidance and assistance to help
                me on my journey."
              </p>
              <p>
                The most profound guidance comes from within ourselves. Allow me
                to help you find your inner voice, so you can better navigate
                the outer world. The techniques I have learnt are about helping
                you to feel empowered, so you can recognise and listen to your
                intuition.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are looking to make profound changes, I know this
                experience intimately. I welcome the opportunity to work
                alongside you to explore new possibilities of a meaningful life.
